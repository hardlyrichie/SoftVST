# SoftVST

Team SoftVST: Sparsh Bansal, Richard Gao

_Start Date: Week of Feb 18th_

_End Date: Report due March 24th_

## Project Goal

The goal of our project is to create a VST with a GUI in C/C++ as well as to learn how to program in both these languages better. Our lower bound would be a program that is able to synthesize/modulate audio with a few adjustable parameters, while a stretch goal would be to integrate our program with a Digital Audio Workstation with a multi-functional GUI. 

## Learning Goals

Our learning goals are to acquire more familiarity with C and learn C++ by working on a project that interests us: developing software to interface with DAWs. Learning the basics of audio programming is also part of our learning goal, especially understanding the software behind synthesizers and common effects. This may include researching about DSP and signal processing.

## Resources

We are currently looking into how a VST works and it’s core features in order to learn what it should contain in terms of functionality. We have found the Github repository of last year’s SoftSys batch who have made an attempt to do a similar [project](https://github.com/DuncanDHall/SoftSysCynthesis). We intend to use that as a resource to get started on and draw inspiration from. We have also found a book on Audio Programming called: The Audio Programming Book by Richard Boulanger and Victor Lazzarini. We can use some help in finding good resources in learning C++.

## First Steps

* Narrow down the project definition (Richard & Sparsh)
  * Currently we are interested in making a VST, but have not narrowed down what kind of VST we are interested in making. We     will ideate and determine what kind of plugin we will be developing.

* Sketch up a MVP of the GUI (Sparsh & Richard)
  * Draw up a sketch of what we envision our VST to look like

* Research and explore useful libraries (ex. Juce) (Richard & Sparsh)
  * Try out some library examples


**Summary: We are trying to create a VST in C/C++**
